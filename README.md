# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytical Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytical Modelling Project. 

In this project, I take a single source dataset and transform it into three distinct schema designs:  
Star Schema, Snowflake Schema, and One Big Table (OBT). 
Each model represents a different approach to organizing data for analytics designed with clarity, efficiency, and real-world use cases in mind.

 What You'll Learn

- 🔹 How to build a **Star Schema** that’s simple, fast, and BI-friendly  
- 🔹 How to normalize dimensions into a **Snowflake Schema** to reduce redundancy  
- 🔹 How to denormalize everything into a **One Big Table** for simplicity and flat reporting  
- 🔹 The impact of each model on query performance, storage, and data integrity  
- 🔹 How to document models with draw.io diagrams and structure your project like a pro  

 Schemas in Focus

 1. Star Schema  
The go-to structure for reporting and dashboards. Easy joins, fast queries, and perfect for tools like Power BI or Tableau.

2.  Snowflake Schema  
A normalized version of the star. Cleaner, more maintainable, and often used in large-scale enterprise DW environments.

 3. One Big Table (OBT)  
Everything in one flat table. Great for ad hoc analysis, data export, or machine learning inputs.
